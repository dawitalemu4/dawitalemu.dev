In short, I took the height of the div and the top, the scroll position of the user, and calculated the % of where their scroll position is on the div. I also offset the top a bit for timing reasons, as it would start counting the % immediately as the top of the div showed up on the screen, but the effect is cooler when you can see it happeningðŸ˜¹. Why I'm using this component's parallax function is, because believe it or not, I spent 20 minutes or so confused why 'if (effectToggle === true)' wouldn't display 'On', until I tried false like how it is now.

The typescript basically fetches the images from my firebase db and has a function that makes any image clicked on become a modal. What made this challenging was figuring out how to make an image that was clicked on become the image in the modal, as the image on the modal would default to the latest image that was fetched. How I solved this was by running another for loop to pick up the specific image that was clicked on as url and made the selectedImage prop = url when the image is clicked on.
